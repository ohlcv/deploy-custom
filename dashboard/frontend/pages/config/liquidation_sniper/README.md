# Liquidation Sniper Strategy

## Strategy Overview

The Liquidation Sniper Strategy is specifically designed to capture price rebounds following liquidation events in the cryptocurrency market. This strategy monitors liquidation events on Binance, and when a large volume of liquidations occurs within a specified time frame, it executes Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) trades on the configured exchange to profit from the price rebound.

## How It Works

1. **Monitor Liquidation Events**: The strategy monitors liquidation events on Binance, which occur when highly leveraged traders are forced to close positions due to sharp price movements
2. **Accumulate Liquidation Data**: Total liquidation amounts are accumulated over a specific time interval (e.g., 15 seconds)
3. **Trigger Trades**: When the liquidation amount reaches a set threshold (e.g., $10 million), DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) trades are executed
4. **Profit Mechanism**: Profits are generated by capturing the common price rebounds that follow large-scale liquidations

## Applicable Scenarios

* During high volatility in cryptocurrency markets
* Markets with concentrated high-leverage trading
* Highly liquid mainstream token trading pairs

## Detailed Parameter Explanations

### Liquidation Side
- **LONG**: Monitors long liquidation events. When prices drop, leveraged long positions are liquidated, and the strategy buys to capture the rebound.
- **SHORT**: Monitors short liquidation events. When prices rise, leveraged short positions are liquidated, and the strategy sells to capture the pullback.

### Trading Pairs vs. Liquidation Pairs
- **Trading Pair**: The actual trading pair you're trading on your selected exchange.
- **Liquidations Pair**: The trading pair being monitored for liquidation events on Binance. These can be different but should be correlated (e.g., you can monitor BTC-USDT liquidations but trade XBT-USDT on KuCoin).

### DCA Configuration
- **DCA Levels Percent**: Defines the price positions for each buy/sell level, expressed as percentages. For example, 0.01 means a position 1% below/above the trigger price.
- **DCA Amounts Percent**: Defines the proportion of funds allocated to each level. The sum should be 1 (100%).

## Strategy Logic

When large liquidation events occur, they typically create temporary market imbalances and price distortions. This strategy aims to:

1. For long liquidations (price drops): Place buy orders at strategic levels below the current price to capture the rebound
2. For short liquidations (price rises): Place sell orders at strategic levels above the current price to capture the pullback

The strategy uses DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) to spread risk across multiple price levels, increasing the probability of capturing the optimal entry point.

## Usage Considerations

1. **Exchange Selection**: Liquidation monitoring always occurs on Binance, but the actual trading can be executed on any supported exchange.
2. **Fund Management**: Ensure you allocate a reasonable amount of funds to the strategy, neither too large nor too small.
3. **Leverage Settings**: Set appropriate leverage according to your risk tolerance. If using spot trading, set leverage to 1.
4. **Liquidation Threshold**: Adjust the liquidation trigger threshold based on the liquidity and volatility of the trading pair. Mainstream tokens like BTC can use higher thresholds (e.g., $10 million), while smaller market cap tokens may require lower thresholds.
5. **Time Limit**: Set a reasonable time limit; rebounds typically occur within a short timeframe, with 30 minutes to 2 hours recommended.

## Strategy Advantages

1. **Event-Driven**: The strategy is triggered based on actual market events (large-scale liquidations) rather than relying solely on price indicators.
2. **Automated Execution**: Fully automated monitoring and trade execution, requiring no manual intervention.
3. **Risk Control**: Built-in stop loss, take profit, and time limits ensure controlled risk.
4. **Cross-Exchange Advantage**: Leverages Binance's liquidation data but can execute trades on any preferred exchange.

## Strategy Risks

1. **Market Reversals**: Not all liquidation events are followed by price rebounds; the market may continue moving in its original direction.
2. **Timing Issues**: The timing and strength of rebounds may vary based on market conditions.
3. **Liquidation Data Delays**: Delays in acquiring and processing liquidation data may affect trading timing.

## Target Audience

This strategy is suitable for traders with some understanding of cryptocurrency futures markets who are willing to take moderate risks to capture short-term trading opportunities. It is particularly valuable for users seeking trading strategies based on market microstructure and liquidity events.

## Technical Implementation

This strategy is based on the DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) executor in the Hummingbot V2 framework, implementing the trading strategy by monitoring Binance's liquidation event data source and creating and managing DCA executors at appropriate times.
